//! Runtime / binary attestation rung (task B3, extended by rung 3a): measure
//! the serving binary the node actually runs and record a signed reference to
//! it in the exchange capsule's provenance, shaped like executable
//! code-signing.
//!
//! ## HONESTY GRADES — read this before trusting the rung
//!
//! Two grades ship today. Both are carried IN the signed record's
//! `measurement_class` field (not only in these docs), so a verifier reading
//! the capsule sees the honesty grade inline and cannot be told "attested
//! binary" without also being told which grade backs it.
//!
//! ### `self_measured` (the floor — every platform)
//!
//! The very process being attested hashes *its own* on-disk executable
//! ([`std::env::current_exe`]) and signs the digest with the node key it
//! already holds. It proves only:
//!
//!   > "a process holding the node key reported *this* SHA-256 for the file it
//!   >  believes is its own executable, at the moment it measured."
//!
//! It does **NOT** prove the running binary was un-tampered before it hashed
//! itself. A compromised binary can compute the hash of a *pristine* copy on
//! disk (or of anything else) and sign that. Self-measurement has no root of
//! trust below the thing doing the measuring.
//!
//! ### `os_measured` (macOS — an independent measurer beneath the process)
//!
//! On macOS the KERNEL (AMFI) independently computes and validates the
//! running process's code-directory hash (cdhash) at `exec` — a value this
//! process does not compute and cannot redirect: it is bound to the calling
//! PID, not to any path the process supplies. [`measure_self`] reads it via
//! `csops(2) CS_OPS_CDHASH` and signs it JOINTLY with the self-computed
//! `binary_sha256` (see [`BinaryAttestation::verify_signature`]), so a
//! verifier sees BOTH the OS's measurement and the process's own claim, and
//! neither can be swapped independently of the other after signing.
//!
//! `os_measured` is trustworthy only up to, and the record says so IN-BAND
//! ([`KernelAttestation`] + the `context` string in
//! [`BinaryAttestation::to_value`]):
//!   * **SIP enabled** — the whole argument rests on AMFI enforcing signature
//!     validity at `exec`; SIP-off lets a root attacker disable that.
//!   * **a non-root attacker** — root can disable SIP / bypass AMFI.
//!   * **this binary's signing strength** — a local `cargo build` is only
//!     **ad-hoc** signed (cdhash exists, but no Developer-ID / notarization /
//!     library-validation entitlement); the `ad_hoc_signature` caveat carries
//!     that honestly rather than letting `os_measured` read as a stronger
//!     claim than it is.
//!
//! `os_measured` does **NOT** prove hardware-rooted measurement — no TEE, no
//! hardware register is involved — so it must never be confused with
//! `tee_measured` (unbuilt; would require a TEE measuring into a hardware
//! register before `exec`, e.g. Linux+TPM or SEV-SNP). A root attacker with
//! SIP disabled is the named residual only `tee_measured` closes; see
//! `docs/REDTEAM-RUNG3.md`.
//!
//! ## Graceful degradation
//!
//! [`measure_self`] NEVER fabricates a measurement. If the kernel query is
//! unavailable (non-macOS, a sandbox that denies `csops`, or the kernel
//! reporting the process's own signature as not currently valid) it degrades
//! to `self_measured` — never a zero/placeholder cdhash, never a fabricated
//! `os_measured`. If the running binary's path cannot be resolved or read at
//! all, the rung records nothing: [`measure_self`] returns `None` and the
//! capsule carries the honest empty `binary_attestation` evidence slot.
