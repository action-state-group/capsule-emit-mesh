//! Settlement records in the Evidence panes: the payer node's own sealed
//! observations of `payment.lifecycle.v1`, joined to exchanges by
//! `exchange_id`.
//!
//! The plugin seals one record per lifecycle event it observed, carrying the
//! event's fields verbatim under
//! `model_attestation.compute_attestation["x-mesh-settlement-v1"]`. This
//! module only reads those records; it never computes a sum, a balance or a
//! rate, and it never reaches into the wallet.
//!
//! What one node's records can say, and what they cannot:
//!
//! - The channel is the payer's. Every record here is this node's view as the
//!   paying side, so the provider's book is always reported as
//!   `not_available` until the provider side emits its own observations.
//! - The provider's side of a payment is not something the payer's events
//!   can see, so nothing about it is sent: per-peer counts carry only this
//!   node's own facts, beside `provider_book: "not_available"`.
//! - An exchange with no settlement records has no payment summary at all
//!   (`settlement: null`). That covers a free exchange, a node with payments
//!   off, and a paid request that failed before authorization (the host emits
//!   no lifecycle phase for it). None of those is "unpaid".
//! - The payer's invoice record can arrive after the first token (the host
//!   authorizes at the first canonical token), so nothing here orders
//!   settlement records against the exchange's own record.
