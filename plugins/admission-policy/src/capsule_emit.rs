//! Wires `capsule-producer` (COSE-sign -> chain -> ledger) into this plugin,
//! closing the #1332 integration gap: previously `capsule-producer` and the
//! admission plugin were two crates with zero shared dependency (see
//! `adv-mesh-1332-e2e-scorecard`). Every ALLOWED chat-completion exchange
//! this plugin itself serves is turned into a signed, chained, ledgered AAC
//! (`x-mesh-poc-v1` mapping) -- `effect_request_digest`/`effect_response_digest`
//! are the canonical JSON-DIGEST (RFC 8785 JCS) of the parsed request/response
//! body, matching this crate's own `jcs::json_digest` and the Python sidecar's
//! `capsule_sidecar.digest_json` (spec §5.1) -- NOT a raw hash of the wire
//! bytes, so reserializing the identical semantic content (key order,
//! whitespace) does not change the digest, and it stays comparable across
//! implementations. Mutating the actual content still changes `capsule_id`.
