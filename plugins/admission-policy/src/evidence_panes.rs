//! The Evidence page's three panes, built from this plugin's own ledger
//! directory and served by the plugin's `panes/*` routes (`evidence_routes`,
//! `web-ui/DATA-ROUTES.md`).
//!
//! Reads `<ledger_dir>/capsules.jsonl` (this node's records, padding left
//! out), `checkpoints.jsonl` (the Integrity card) and the record-push door's
//! held-artifact store `received-capsules.jsonl` (the other side's records),
//! the same on-disk shapes the Python reference panes read. No network call.
//!
//! **Scope of this first cut, verified against a live capsule-emit-mesh
//! checkout, not guessed.** Every field derivable from the raw ledger
//! records alone -- with no signature/chain re-verification and no data
//! this record's own writer didn't put there -- matches
//! `accountability_pane_routes.build_pane_{a,b,c}_json` byte-for-byte on a
//! plugin-shaped fixture (no checkpoint, no peer-fetch, no serving-
//! provenance block): capsule id/timestamp, `model_claimed`'s honest
//! last-resort default (`friendly_model_name`'s final fallback,
//! `capsule_mesh_viewer.py:365`, always `"local model"` when no serving-
//! provenance data has landed yet), the Pane-A rungs' structural
//! defaults (`freshness`/`runtime_binding`/`tee_citation`/
//! `hardware_inventory` = `"absent"`, `log_integrity` =
//! `"present-unverified"` -- `verify_ok is None` reads as "present, not
//! yet independently verified", never a fabricated PASS/FAIL), exchange
//! grouping (`exchange_key_for`), and role labelling (`label_role`,
//! `source_log = "plugin"`, whose own default-by-source table already
//! says a plugin-written record is always this node acting as the
//! serving PROVIDER -- `capsule_mesh_view.py:81-83`).
//!
//! ** retirement, native reader only:**
//! Pane A's `cross_party` cell and Pane B's per-row cross-party cell used
//! to carry the `rung`/`unilateral_fallback` ladder word (still live in
//! `capsule_accountability_tab.py`/`peer_accountability_tab.py` upstream,
//! matching `f0e3af6`'s note that Pane A/B were explicitly out of that
//! task's scope). This demo runs native/sidecar-DOWN, so THIS reader is
//! where a stranger reading the raw pane JSON would actually see the
//! retired word -- both cells now emit the same five-state property-map
//! shape (`state`/`text`, `state` one of `PASS`/`FAIL`/`NOT_PRESENT`/
//! `NOT_CHECKED`/`INCONCLUSIVE`) Pane C's `properties` map already uses,
//! always `NOT_PRESENT` here (no counterparty identity data exists on a
//! plugin-written record yet -- the same honest absence the old rung
//! value encoded, in the current vocabulary). This is a deliberate,
//! documented non-parity divergence from the Python reference (which
//! hasn't migrated Pane A/B yet) -- not a byte-for-byte port gap.
//!
//! Two tranches stay `NOT_CHECKED`/absent/null on purpose, matching gaps
//! `accountability_pane_routes.py`'s own docstring already names, not new
//! ones this cut invented:
//!
//! 1. **Peer-fetch cells** (Pane B's `history`/`served`/`verdicts`) --
//!    deferred with the peer-fetch work
//!    (`accountability_pane_routes.py:17-20`). Their real payloads carry
//!    long operator-facing prose and `mine_for_reference` sub-structures
//!    that exist only to explain an already-deferred gap; duplicating that
//!    prose here would be two copies of the same UI copy to keep in sync,
//!    not a second implementation of a check.
//! 2. **The nine-key assurance map** (Pane C's `properties`/`header_state`,
//!    Pane A's `verify_ok`) -- `content_binding`/`continuity` recompute the
//!    capsule's own JCS digest and hash-chain link, `producer_signature`
//!    verifies its COSE_Sign1 statement. All three are real cryptographic
//!    re-verification, already written once in Rust in capsule-producer's
//!    `jcs`/`cose`/`verify` modules -- porting that in is real, bounded
//!    follow-on work, deliberately out of this cut so it doesn't ship as a
//!    silent partial implementation that looks byte-exact and quietly
//!    diverges the day a tampered record lands.
