//! "Asked of you": this node's own log of the requests other nodes made of
//! it, and what it answered. The provider's half of the double entry; the
//! Evidence page's drill reads it (`evidence_panes::read_received_log`).
//!
//! The same file and line shape the Python reference wrote: `received_log.jsonl`, one
//! `{ts, path, requester_id, subject_kind, status, reason}` object per line,
//! in the directory `evidence_routes::EvidenceSource::received_log_dir`
//! resolves. **Opt-in, as before:** nothing is written unless that directory
//! exists. Never the ledger directory: this log is not evidence.
//!
//! **Best-effort.** An answer is decided before it is logged, and a logging
//! failure never changes it.
//!
//! **Bounded.** The requester's id is its own word, so it is cut to
//! [`MAX_REQUESTER_ID_CHARS`] characters, and a line is never longer than
//! the few fields it names. The file stops growing at
//! [`MAX_RECEIVED_LOG_BYTES`]: past it, a line is not written, and the
//! dropped lines are counted ([`dropped`]) and reported in the node's own
//! log (the first drop, then every 1000th). The Evidence page shows only the
//! newest lines anyway; an operator who wants more moves the file aside.
