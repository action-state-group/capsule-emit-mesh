//! Receive a peer's pushed record, in-process: the checks of the Python
//! reference receiver (`record_push.py`), in the same order, with the same
//! answers.
//!
//! **What arrives.** A peer pushes its own sealed half of an exchange, either
//! bare or as a bundle (`{"record_push_bundle": 1, "capsule", "inclusion",
//! "checkpoint"}`) that also proves the half is in the peer's log under a
//! checkpoint it signed. A split's coordinator may add `split_stage_records`.
//! This is plugin-internal behaviour, not a standardized wire, and may change.
//!
//! **The order of the checks** (each refusal is signed by this node):
//! 1. The bytes parse strictly ([`crate::strict_json`]), else
//!    `request_malformed`.
//! 2. A bundle carries exactly its members with exactly their types, else
//!    `bundle_malformed`. From here on, a bundle's structural refusals are
//!    `bundle_malformed` and a bare push's are `request_malformed`: that
//!    reason in reply to a bundle is how a sender recognises a receiver that
//!    predates bundles.
//! 3. `record_at_completion: off` refuses `policy_decline`.
//! 4. A push with no sender id, or from a sender with no announced key
//!    ([`crate::peer_keys`]), is refused `signature_unverified`. These cheap
//!    refusals come before any work on the record's bytes: an unknown sender
//!    is refused before its record is checked.
//! 5. The half passes the Class 1 checks on its own bytes, as the reference
//!    verifier runs them (capsule-emit's `structure`, including that its
//!    `capsule_id` recomputes), else malformed.
//! 6. The announced key is the half's `key_id` and the half's signature
//!    verifies under it, else `signature_unverified`.
//! 7. What a served half claims about the exchange agrees with this node's
//!    own record of it, else `served_by_mismatch` / `model_mismatch`.
//! 8. A split's carried stage records are each valid and named by the main
//!    record's receipt, else `bundle_malformed`.
//! 9. A bundle's checkpoint is signed by the same announced key and its proof
//!    puts the half under that checkpoint's root, else `inclusion_unverified`;
//!    and it does not contradict a checkpoint already held for the same key
//!    and log (`checkpoint_equivocation`) or come from before the newest one
//!    at a size never vouched for (`checkpoint_stale`).
//!
//! Every refusal from step 4 on is recorded in `rejected-record-pushes.jsonl`,
//! up to [`MAX_REJECTED_LOG_BYTES`]; past that, the refusals still go out,
//! signed, and the ones not recorded are counted and logged. A refusal
//! issued before the record's signature verified is recorded only while the
//! log is under a sixteenth of that ([`UNAUTHENTICATED_LOG_SHARE`]), so
//! anyone's flood leaves room for the refusals of authenticated pushes.
//!
//! **What is kept.** A received half is evidence this node holds, not a
//! record it made: it goes to the held-artifact store
//! `received-capsules.jsonl`, as transmitted, with a provenance line; a
//! bundle's proof and checkpoint go to `received-inclusion.jsonl`. None of it
//! enters this node's own chain. The chained record of the receipt is the
//! citing record the bridge seals after this returns. A record already held
//! from the same sender is not stored again: a resent push is acknowledged
//! and adds nothing to disk. A line of a held store that does not parse (a
//! write torn by a crash) is skipped, counted and logged; the next line
//! written after such a fragment starts on its own line.
//!
//! **Bounded work.** The body is at most `MAX_SIDE_STREAM_BYTES` before it
//! gets here. Every size a peer states is checked before anything is sized by
//! it: a proof is verified by `cll`, which refuses a tree of 2^50 nodes or
//! more before it builds a path, and a split carries at most
//! [`MAX_SPLIT_STAGE_RECORDS`] records, counted before any is read.
