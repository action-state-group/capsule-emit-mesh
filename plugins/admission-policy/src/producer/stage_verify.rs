//! The requester's offline check of a split request (design §7.2): from the
//! coordinator's main record and the stage records it carried, work out each
//! stage's cell on the stage strip and whether each hop's two ends agree.
//!
//! What `agree` means is narrow on purpose: both ends of one hop committed to
//! the same frames on one lane. It says nothing about whether the two stages
//! are independent, or whether either computed its slice correctly (design
//! §0, §9). A missing end, or a required lane empty on both ends, is a `gap`,
//! never agreement.
//!
//! [`verify_split`] is the core, over already-extracted blocks; the Python
//! reference (`mesh_split_stage.py`) implements the same function and both
//! run over `tests/fixtures/split-stage/hop-cases.json`.
//! [`verify_split_records`] wraps it for sealed records: it recomputes every
//! `capsule_id` first. Signatures are checked by the receiver on receipt, not
//! repeated here.
