//! The capsule producer this plugin seals with. The neutral pieces (JCS,
//! keys, COSE, the ledger, checkpoints, padding, sequencing, timestamps,
//! the anchor client) come from the `capsule-emit`
//! crate. The mesh-specific record kinds and the split-stage and runtime
//! attestation modules live here, written against capsule-emit's public
//! extension points; nothing mesh-specific enters capsule-emit.
