//! Split-inference stage records on the live plugin
//! (`docs/DESIGN-split-stage-records.md` §6).
//!
//! **Stage side.** One `skippy.stage.v1` event per request per stage: the
//! plugin seals the stage record and pushes it to the coordinator over
//! `record-push/1`. The stage never learns the end requester.
//!
//! **Coordinator side.** The stage-0 event names the split key, the
//! assignments and the `openai.exchange.v1` `exchange_id` of the same
//! request. [`SplitCollector`] holds that exchange's terminal envelope instead
//! of sealing it at once, gathers the stage records the receiver accepts, and
//! releases the split when every remote stage has arrived or the deadline
//! passes. [`plan_split`] then turns what arrived into the stage-exchange
//! records, the receipt and the stage records to carry to the requester. A
//! stage record that arrives after that is still received, and its ordinary
//! `counterparty_half` citing record is the follow-up; the sealed main record
//! is never rewritten.
//!
//! **No host emits `skippy.stage.v1` yet** (design §8). The channel is not
//! declared in the manifest, and the event shape here is the one the host
//! seam is asked for. The contract this module relies on, beyond §8: stage 0
//! emits its event before the `openai.exchange.v1` terminal event of the
//! same request. A terminal event that arrives first is sealed as an
//! ordinary exchange, and the late stage-0 event is refused and counted.
