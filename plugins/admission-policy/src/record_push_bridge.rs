//! Seam A1 -- the record-push-at-completion
//! transport. Mechanical sibling of `mesh_evidence_bridge.rs`: the SAME
//! `OpenMeshStreamRequest`/`connect_stream` mesh-stream mechanism, a NEW
//! declared channel (`record-push/1`), bridging bytes on both ends straight
//! to `record_push.py`'s already-shipped, already-tested receiver
//! (`evidence_server.py`'s `/evidence/record-push` door, `handle_record_push`)
//! -- never re-implemented in Rust. Zero upstream (`mesh-llm`) code.
//!
//! **Wire shape.** `push_record`'s own contract is "body = the pushed
//! capsule's own canonical JSON bytes -- opaque at the transport level"
//! (`record_push.py` module doc) -- unchanged here. What this module adds on
//! top, ON THE STREAM (never inside the JSON body, so `record_push.py`'s own
//! opacity contract stays intact) is exactly one line before it: the
//! pusher's own self-declared mesh peer id, then `\n`, then the capsule
//! bytes unchanged. The responder splits on the first `\n` and forwards the
//! id as the SAME `X-Mesh-Requester-Id` header `/evidence-request` already
//! uses for its own self-declared caller identity (`evidence_server.py`'s
//! own "relationship gate" doc note) -- one self-attestation convention,
//! reused, not invented twice. `evidence_server.py`'s door verifies the
//! capsule's cryptographic signature against this claimed identity's
//! announced key before ever storing it as a sibling (`record_push.py`'s
//! `handle_record_push`) -- this module never itself authenticates anything;
//! it only carries the claim and the bytes.
//!
//! **Why a self-declared id, not a mesh-authenticated one.** `mesh-llm-plugin
//! 0.76.2`'s `OpenStreamRequest` (verified against the vendored crate
//! source) carries no sender/requester identity field at all, and
//! `PluginContext` exposes no "who is this connection from" accessor -- the
//! RESPONDER genuinely cannot learn the sender's peer id from the mesh
//! transport itself in this SDK version. Self-declaration on the wire, then
//! a REAL cryptographic check against an announced key on the receiving
//! side, is the same discipline `/evidence-request`'s existing
//! `X-Mesh-Requester-Id` self-attestation already uses -- this module does
//! not invent a weaker trust model, it reuses the one already shipped.
//!
//! **The pushing peer's mesh node id is NOT capturable here either
//! (re-verified against both the 0.76.2 proto and the mesh-llm host source).** Every
//! `OpenStreamRequest` field the responder sees (`stream_id`,
//! `content_type`, `correlation_id`, `metadata_json`, ...) is copied
//! VERBATIM from the requester's own `OpenMeshStreamRequest` by the host's
//! `open_stream_request_from_mesh_request` -- all requester-controlled, so
//! anything carried there (including a node id tucked into `metadata_json`)
//! would be one more self-declaration, not a transport attestation. The
//! receiving host DOES hold the transport-authenticated remote identity --
//! its inbound handler is `handle_plugin_mesh_stream(_remote:
//! iroh::EndpointId, ..)` off the QUIC connection -- but it discards
//! `_remote` and never surfaces it to the plugin. Until the SDK grows a
//! host-filled source-peer field on `OpenStreamRequest`, a
//! `received_from_node_id` cannot be recorded honestly, so it is not
//! recorded at all (never synthesized); the ledger carries only the
//! door-verified self-declared `received_from`.
//!
//! **Push-a-bundle.** When the sender's
//! checkpoint cadence is on, the JSON body is a bundle instead of the bare
//! capsule: `{"record_push_bundle": 1, "capsule": <the half, unchanged>,
//! "inclusion": {"leaf_index", "proof"}, "checkpoint": <signed checkpoint>}`
//! (~2.5 KB). The door verifies all three (`record_push.py`) and its success
//! reply names the verified inclusion; this bridge then seals the
//! `counterparty_half` citing record AND a second, `counterparty_inclusion`
//! citing record -- the row reaches "in their log" in one step. A door that
//! predates bundles refuses one `request_malformed` (no top-level
//! `capsule_id`); the sender then re-pushes the bare capsule once.
//!
//! **Single `on_open_stream` slot.** The plugin SDK gives a plugin exactly
//! ONE `on_open_stream` handler slot (`SimplePlugin::open_stream_handler:
//! Option<OpenStreamHandler>`, verified against the 0.76.2 crate source) and
//! `OpenStreamRequest` carries no channel name to dispatch on -- `main.rs`'s
//! single registered handler dispatches between this module and
//! `mesh_evidence_bridge` by `content_type`, the one field both sides set to
//! a distinct, stable value for exactly this purpose.
