// Copy pin: wording the Evidence surface
// retired must never come back. Two stale-base branches merged into the freeze
// line once and quietly re-imported it ("Ask a peer" went 0 -> 5), so this
// scans the SOURCE of every shipped Evidence file rather than trusting that
// each component test happens to render the right state. Comments are
// stripped first: history notes may quote a retired phrase; code and copy may
// not.
//
// In the plugin bundle this scans every non-test source the bundle ships
// (`src/`, vendored console primitives included). The fork's copy of this test
// also scanned the host's Rust pane (`capsule_panes_native.rs`); that pane is
// still host code on the fork, so its scan stays there and moves here with the
// pane.
