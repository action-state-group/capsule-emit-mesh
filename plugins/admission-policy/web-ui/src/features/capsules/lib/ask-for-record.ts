// "Ask them for their record" (UX §3): after the timeout, a row whose other
// side's record hasn't arrived can ask that node for it. The plugin sends one
// evidence request over the mesh and verifies the reply before handing it
// over (`api/evidenceRequestClient.ts`); this module judges what came back,
// the same way the row judges a record that was pushed: nothing here is
// trusted because it arrived.
//
//   - only a reply the plugin verified counts (`verification`): a refusal
//     signed with the key this node was told the peer signs with, naming OUR
//     request, or an artifact whose records are proven in the peer's log
//     under a checkpoint that key signed. Anything else -- no announced key,
//     a reply that proves nothing -- leaves the row "asked, no reply yet",
//     and the row says why (`askReplyNote`);
//   - a refusal is also checked here, in the browser, under the announced
//     key and the request digest the plugin sent. `no_such_subject` is their
//     signed "I have no record of this"; `coverage_unsatisfiable` means they
//     hold it but no checkpoint covers it yet, so the row stays asked and can
//     ask again; any other reason is a signed decline;
//   - a record goes through THE row gate (`deriveRightCellState`) as a fetched
//     half: it closes the row only if its id recomputes, its signature
//     verifies under the announced key, it came from the node that served us
//     and both digests equal ours.
