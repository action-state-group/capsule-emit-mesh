 *     resolved).
 * CLOSED needs all four: the signature verified against the peer's announced
 * key, the body recomputes to its `capsule_id`, both `effect` digests equal
 * ours (§6.2/L-G), and the provider check (`providerMatches`, provisional).
 * CONTRADICTED: the body does not recompute to its id, both sides carry
 * real digests that differ, or the provider's half names other model weights
 * than it served us under (`modelSwapped`). A PUSHED half from a node that did not serve the
