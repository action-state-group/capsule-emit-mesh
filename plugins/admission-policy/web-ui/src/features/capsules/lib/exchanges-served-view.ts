// actually emits on pane-a's `card.served_summary` -- never

// EXCHANGES per model (`by_model[*].served`/`completed`/`failed`), not
// tokens, so this view labels them for what they are rather than borrowing
// "tokens" language the data doesn't support. There is no symmetric
// "asked" (this node AS REQUESTER) fold exposed yet -- rendered as an
// honest absence, the same discipline `asked_cell`'s "this node doesn't
// persist a send log yet" already uses on Pane B, never a fabricated zero.
